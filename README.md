# Forecasting of phones prices with NLP
Text mining with data labeling and forecasting


#### Task description:
***
The goal is to prepare a PoC which predicts the price of used iPhones 11. As the data is web-scraped from an online marketplace, it was created by random people providing different and unstructured information in natural language. It also contains plenty of noise, like non-iPhone offers or multiple items sold through one advertisement. 
There are also multiple different kinds of iPhone 11, which is not directly indicated in the dataset and thus requires analysis of the provided description for each offer.  

#### Task approach:
***
- Understanding and analysis of the original dataset
- Dataset cleaning
- Text mining to categorize offers into types of iPhones
- Exploration of the cleaned dataset
- Forecasting
- Evaluation

#### Data:
***
The data contains web-scraped information from an online marketplace OLX, more precisely offers in Polish created by users of this portal. Offers have details specified by their creators (mainly sellers), like offer titles, descriptions and state of items (condition).  
The prices are expressed in PLN (1 EUR = ~4.5 PLN).
